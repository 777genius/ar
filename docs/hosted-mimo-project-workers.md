# Registered project MiMo workers

Agents select MiMo through the existing `codex_goal_project_refill_worker` or `codex_goal_project_create_job` MCP tools. There is no separate credential argument or provider process to launch manually. The project broker reserves the account, verifies the registered manifest and launch-admission receipt, and submits the owned runtime/provider services.

Set these provider fields alongside the usual project, controller, workspace, prompt and admission inputs:

```json
{
  "modelBackend": "xiaomi-mimo-token-plan",
  "accounts": ["account-q"],
  "model": "mimo-v2.6-pro",
  "executionEngine": "app-server",
  "maxAccountCycles": 1,
  "prewarmOnStart": false
}
```

For newly created MiMo manifests, omitted model, engine and cycle count resolve to the values above; prewarm defaults to false. Explicit conflicting settings are preserved and rejected by the registered execution contract. Do not send `mimoAccounts`, credential environment variables, auth paths, custom process factories, report-mode overrides or lifecycle policy overrides. The trusted runtime derives its finite contained turn and structured report.

## Project authorization and host setup

The controller's `projectAccessScope.allowedAccountIds` must explicitly contain `account-q`. Existing scopes do not gain it automatically. A trusted operator can use `codex_goal_project_update_controller_scope` to preview and confirm an updated scope preserving its existing roots, project identity and other allowed accounts. Adding the shared MiMo slot checks only the root-owned credential metadata; it does not require a ChatGPT `account-q/auth.json` or expose key bytes. The worker's inherited scope and current admission receipt are validated again at launch and finalization.

The broker must run as the initial root operator on the Linux host with the exact installed runtime and fixed shared MiMo credential prepared by the supported host installation procedure. Namespace-local root, a local macOS MCP process and an unprivileged SSH session cannot submit this native route. Credential bytes are admitted independently at provider launch and delivered through the owned stdin frame. Do not copy them into a project, prompt, environment argument or account auth file.

This registered Worker route is separate from global hosted activation. It does not activate MiMo controllers, child spawning or unowned ordinary MiMo launches. Hosts with conflicting installed global/managed authority continue to reject this research owner route. Only fresh registered launches with current admission authority are supported; unsupported continuation, checkpoint publishing and caller execution overrides fail before launch.

## Capabilities and completion

The MiMo worker can read, search and edit files within its admitted workspace using bounded MCP tools. Native shell execution, arbitrary command execution, browser/network tools, delegation and project instruction loading are disabled. This means it can produce code changes and reports, but cannot run a build, tests or a shell itself. The orchestrating agent runs those checks through its separately authorized execution tools. The model endpoint remains the fixed MiMo token-plan endpoint.

Each worker has one account cycle, one attempt, at most eight goal turns, no reconnect/prewarm/continuation, and a finite task deadline. The registry owns the canonical durable handoff sink; callers cannot choose an external sink. Completion reconciles the same runtime/provider attempt and publishes the structured outcome plus the existing handoff artifacts. A partial or failed result remains partial or failed.

Use the existing project status and stop tools for the same registered job. A submission timeout is uncertain: reconcile its retained attempt before retrying. Never replace its job ID, remove its ownership records or launch an unmanaged replacement to work around uncertainty.

Run qualification only in newly allocated TEST projects, not existing user repositories. A standalone worker proof does not qualify the registered project broker, scope, reservation and finalization path; validate those boundaries separately with the exact deployed revision.
