# Run Event API

`subscription-runtime` owns normalized runtime facts, durable runtime events and
read-only safety decisions. It does not own orchestration policy.

The target shape is an event-driven runtime kernel:

```text
worker facts -> RunObservationSnapshot -> RunEvent outbox -> read models -> relay/API
```

Higher-level orchestrators consume events and read models:

```text
RunEvent/read-models -> orchestrator policy -> control inbox / notifications
```

## Responsibility Boundary

Runtime layer:

- observes worker progress, result, logs, workspace and capacity;
- normalizes observations into `RunObservationSnapshot`;
- projects snapshots into durable `RunEvent` records;
- projects derived read models such as safety, liveness, workspace, account
  capacity, outcome and control inbox state;
- stores events in an outbox-style store;
- exposes read/watch APIs for orchestration layers.

Orchestrator layer:

- decides when to continue, recover, stop, notify or schedule work;
- chooses queue technology;
- owns product policy, priorities and retry strategy.

Transport adapters:

- may publish `RunEvent` to stdout, MCP, WebSocket, JetStream, Postgres,
  Redis Streams or webhooks;
- must not change the core event contract.

Temporal belongs above this layer. A future Temporal orchestrator should model
long-running goals, timers and retries as workflows, and call
`subscription-runtime` through activities/ports. `worker-core` must not import
Temporal, JetStream, Redis, webhooks or file-system adapters.

## Contract Rules

- Provider/runtime/event discriminators use strict TypeScript enums.
- Do not add extensibility as `"codex" | "claude" | string`.
- Add new enum values intentionally and handle legacy unknowns through explicit
  `Unknown` values or validation failures.
- Payloads must be safe to print. Never include secrets, auth payloads, tokens,
  cookies, API keys or raw provider credentials.
- Runtime read-models are not policy. They can say `safeToContinue=false` with
  `issueKind=dirty_workspace_without_running_worker`; the orchestrator decides
  whether to notify, recover or wait.

## Read Models

Projection state stores these derived models per run:

- `RunSafetyState`: `safeToContinue`, `reviewOnly`, issue kind, reason,
  confidence and evidence.
- `RunLivenessState`: alive/dead/stale/quiet/completed-live plus heartbeat/log
  metadata.
- `WorkspaceState`: clean/dirty/missing/unknown/warning, changed file sample and
  review-only flag.
- `AccountCapacityState`: availability, blocked/cooldown counts, masked account
  identities and safe reasons.
- `RunOutcomeState`: running/completed/failed/blocked/partial/needs-attention.
- `ControlInboxState`: clear/pending/delivered/blocked/unsafe with counts.

These models prevent every consumer from duplicating status parsing. CLI,
dashboard, Temporal workflows and local daemons should read them instead of
parsing `progress.json`, `latest-result.json` or logs directly.

## Delivery Semantics

Current local adapter:

- writes append-only JSONL events;
- dedupes by deterministic `eventId`;
- supports cursor reads;
- tolerates corrupt or partial lines by skipping invalid lines;
- stores projection state and pending transactions per run, provider and registry
  root so shared outboxes cannot mix equal run IDs; host IDs remain metadata;
- emits lifecycle observations when status, liveness or stale flags change,
  allowing replay to reproduce transitions even without a new result artifact;
- exposes explicit retention/compaction primitives. Compaction is never a hidden
  side effect of append/read/project.

Relay layer:

- reads the local outbox by a persisted delivery cursor;
- publishes through `RunEventPublisherPort`;
- advances the delivery cursor only after publish succeeds;
- uses at-least-once delivery semantics;
- expects consumers to dedupe by `eventId`.

Current publisher adapters:

- `StdoutNdjsonRunEventPublisher`: writes one safe JSON event per line.
- `WebhookRunEventPublisher`: posts safe event batches to an HTTP endpoint.
  It treats non-2xx responses and timeouts as publish failures. The relay cursor
  should only advance after this publisher succeeds.

Future queue adapters should keep the same semantics:

- at-least-once delivery;
- idempotent consumers;
- deterministic event IDs;
- replay from durable store;
- backpressure handled outside worker execution.

## Retention and Compaction

Local JSONL compaction is explicit and cursor-aware:

- default safety mode is `preserve_delivery_cursors`;
- saved delivery cursors are read before rewrite;
- retained event lines are rewritten into a compacted log;
- saved cursors are rebased to the new line positions;
- unread lines for saved cursors are not removed in preserve mode;
- `force` mode can remove unread lines, but reports
  `invalidatedUnreadEvents=true` per affected cursor;
- corrupt event lines can be dropped only when `dropInvalidLines` is explicitly
  enabled.

Run compaction as a maintenance action while local relays for the same outbox
are quiesced. The primitive protects saved cursor files, but it cannot rebase a
cursor that a concurrently running relay has already loaded into memory.

Supported policy knobs:

- `keepEventsAfter`: remove older events.
- `keepLatestEventsPerRun`: always retain the latest N events per run.
- `compactDeliveredEvents`: remove lines already consumed by all saved delivery
  cursors.
- `dropInvalidLines`: remove corrupt event log lines during compaction.
- `safetyMode`: `preserve_delivery_cursors` or `force`.

Cursor readers treat a trailing newline as a file terminator, not as an extra
line. This prevents a consumer that read to the end from skipping a later
append.

## Current Surfaces

MCP tools:

- `agent_run_events`: read durable run events from the local outbox. Read-only.
- `codex_goal_events`: Codex-scoped alias for `agent_run_events`.
- `agent_run_state`: read projected run read-model state. Read-only.
- `codex_goal_state`: Codex-scoped alias for `agent_run_state`.
- `agent_run_event_compaction_plan`: read-only local event log compaction plan.
- `agent_run_event_compact`: explicit local event log compaction. Requires
  `confirmCompact=true` and never controls workers.
- `agent_run_project_events`: observe runs and project normalized events into
  the local outbox. Side effects are limited to event/projection state writes.
- `codex_goal_project_events`: Codex-scoped alias for
  `agent_run_project_events`.

`events`, `state` and `event-compaction-plan` are read-only. If stored
projection state is unavailable, `state` may rebuild read models from durable
events and return `replayOnly`. `event-compact` rewrites only the local event log
and delivery cursors, requires `--confirm`, and never starts, stops, continues
or recovers workers. `project-events` observes worker state and writes only the
event outbox plus projection state; it never starts, stops, continues or
recovers workers.

Projection state readers should pass the source (`providerKind` and
`registryRootDir`) when using the SDK. Supplying `providerKind` to projection
also avoids an extra provider-discovery observation. Generic MCP state reads
without `providerKind` inspect retained history to detect ambiguous providers;
use an explicit provider for repeated monitoring. Unscoped SDK reads may resolve a unique source;
multiple sources are explicitly ambiguous. Replay accepts one source at a time.
Generic event inventory can still return multiple sources; retain source filters
when replaying or paging a particular run.

Legacy pending transactions migrate only when every event proves the same
source. Migration writes the scoped transaction before retiring the legacy copy,
and recovers safely if interrupted between those writes. Legacy state without
source ownership is rebuilt from exact-source history only when an initial
observation is retained. If compaction removed that baseline, projection returns
`legacy_run_event_projection_scope_ambiguous`; inspect the durable history and
restore a complete baseline before retrying. It does not silently reset state.

## Important Edge Cases

- Repeated polling must not create duplicate events.
- Process restart must recover projection state before projecting next events.
- Projection state without read models from older versions must be tolerated and
  backfilled as unknown/review-only instead of crashing readers.
- A completed result with a live process is `unsafe_state_detected`, not success.
- `maintenance_paused` is not failure.
- `manual_review_required`, `capacity_blocked`, `stale_needs_inspection` and
  `unsafe_state_mismatch` are different cases and must not be collapsed.
- Dirty workspace with no live worker must stay review-only.
- Log growth, result changes and workspace changes are separate event streams.
- Event readers must survive corrupted JSONL tails.
- Queue publish failure must not lose the local durable event.
- Control events must carry correlation/idempotency data, causation metadata,
  cooldown keys and max-attempt guards so orchestrators can avoid loops and
  duplicated notifications.
- Retention must not delete unread events for saved delivery cursors unless the
  caller explicitly uses force mode and accepts cursor invalidation.
